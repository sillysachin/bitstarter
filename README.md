In this programming assignment we are going to build and deploy an extremely simple crowdfunding site. The site will not actually be able to accept orders yet, but will be on the web. It will be written in basic HTML and CSS, and the presence/absence of particular HTML tags will be scored with an SSJS grader.js script.

The process will expose you to the mechanics of editing and deploying code in a Linux development environment. You will also learn the basics of writing simple command line applications in node.js. Note again that all assignments assume you are running code on AWS on a EC2 t1.micro instance running Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS, unless otherwise specified.

This is the first step towards our final project. As noted in the syllabus, you will be graded on the technical aspects of this process (presence and absence of HTML tags, correctness of JSON output), but it is the qualitative aspects that your customers will ultimately take into account.
